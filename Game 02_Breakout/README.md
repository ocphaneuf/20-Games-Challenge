# Game 02 - Breakout

## Summary
Classic Breakout game built of of similar functions from Pong

## Goals:
- [] Create game space with walls and a ceiling
- [] Add a paddle that can be moved left and right via player inputs
- [] Add a ball that will bounce off of the paddle, walls, and a ceiling
- [] Add square game objects (bricks) into the top of the game space (8 rows of 16 bricks each)
- [] Enable the ball to bounce off of the brickets. When the ball bounces, the brick should disappear
- [] Breaking a brick should add to the player's score
- [] The ball's speed should increase as bricks are broken
- [] The score should be displayed, as well as a life counter. The player starts with three lives. If the player misses the ball, a life should be subtracted. When all lives are used, the game ends

## Stretch goals:
- [] Save the high score between play sessions and display it alongside the player score
- [] Particle effects / animation on brick break
- [] Audio on hits (bounce & brick hit)
- [] Add different colors to the bricks in the rows
- [] The paddle should get narrower once the ball reaches the ceiling
- [] Add a second level once the first level is beaten with increased difficulty (paddle size and ball speed)
- [] Add a combo system correlated to the colors, e.g. hit red after green to get a score multiplier
- [] Add spawning powerups to hit (enlarge paddle, multi-ball)

## What I Learned:
- Better template folder structure for a game to have assets/sprites, assets/music, assets/sounds, assets/sprites
- Better to start with a simple background for the prototype rather than create the perfect background/image asset from the beginning
- Plenty of free assets to download and use; create sprite node, drag in the png file, click region, edit region, select the specific image from the full set
